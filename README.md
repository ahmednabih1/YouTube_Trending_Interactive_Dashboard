# YouTube_Trending_Interactive_Dashboard
Built upon a cleaned version from the YouTube Trending dashboard found on kaggle.

The cleaned version can be found here in one of my other repos

This project was made using Plotly Dash library where some interisting insghts and graphs can be found and you can examine the trands and what people like
The insghts was very exciting to me actually as some of them defied the logic in my book.

Enjoy !
